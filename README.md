Case Study: Predicting Housing Prices

Objective: Build a multiple linear regression model to predict housing prices based on various features.

Dataset: Features include square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, lot size, garage size, year built, and neighborhood. Target variable is the price.

Steps:

Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables.
Feature Selection: Choose relevant features, avoid multicollinearity.
Model Building: Build a multiple linear regression model.
Evaluation: Use metrics like MSE, RMSE, R2 on test data.
Improvement: Iterate on feature selection, try scaling, regularization.
Interpretation: Analyze feature impacts using coefficients.
Prediction: Use the model for new data.
Conclusion: Summarize findings, model performance, key features.
Remember, success depends on data quality and proper modeling techniques.
